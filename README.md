# Simple-WeatherFlow-Python-Listener
Very simple UDP broadcast listener for the [WeatherFlow Tempest smart weather system](https://weatherflow.com/tempest-weather-system/) written in Python.
There are various other similar projects but they all seemed too complex so I wanted to make a bare bones version that is straightforward and easy to understand and extend. 

Works with Python 2.7 and 3.x with no dependencies.
